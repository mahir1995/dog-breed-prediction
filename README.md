# Dog Breed Prediction

In this project I'm trying to predict the breed of a dog from images using deep learning. 

To train this model I have used  [Stanford Dog dataset](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/). It consist of images of 120 breeds of dogs. There are total 20580 images of dogs in this dataset. The model is trained with the help of fastai library.

By training this model we got an accuracy rate of 86.5%

One problem here was some breed of dog look very similar that even it was difficult for humans to distinguish them without carefully looking at them.
